    paragraph:
      'Due to pressure from home opposition, Johnson attempts to bring North Vietnam to the bargaining table by halting bombing operations in the area. All the leftover available sorties originally destined for North Vietnam divert to South Vietnam, the Ho Chi Minh Trail, and Northern Laos, which sees a sharp increase in bombing points. This secret redirection to Laos allows the US to avoid political scrutiny. \n Over the course of the entire year, data show that more than 200 bombings missions are flown to Laos on average per day.',

    paragraph:
      'A few months into office, Nixon resumes the air warfare in Cambodia that Johnson began under "Operation Menu". As the new President, Nixon secretly authorizes the use of B-52 heavy bombers and escalates from tactical to mass carpet bombings over the country in order to root out North Vietnamese forces. Contrary to his aims, this only pushes North Vietnam further into Cambodia. Researchers note that many bomb coordinates in the database that hit Cambodia during this time are likely mislabeled as hitting South Vietnam, suggesting falsfication of records.',
