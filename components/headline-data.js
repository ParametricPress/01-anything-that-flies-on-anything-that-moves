Largely unacknowledged by the US, strikes in Laos began in 1964 and often were diverted targets from North Vietnam. “Operation Barrel Roll” supported the Royal Lao Government against the communist Pathet Lao, with the majority of battles taking place in Northern Laos’ Plain of Jars. In return, Prince Phouma of Laos allowed the US to bomb the southeastern portion of the country along the Ho Chi Minh Trail where both Tiger Hound and Steel Tiger take place.',
